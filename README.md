# Project_X  Author: Asit Kumar Singh		Date:10th october 2015

About:- Project_X is about my startup idea which i got in my head during my unemployement period. It is an idea about introducing free offline movie watching by paying very little to the website. Now the basic thing would be to make the movie available to the people at very earliest so that people could watch it in good prints and not waiting for long time for the movie to come in torrents after 3-4 months of period of time.


How would movie production will be benefited by this:- our product will be key aspect in stopping piracy and torrents download. We will provide movie very early to the viewers and also will not let them reproduce the same on any other machine.


USP of our product:- Once our product is downloaded for one machine it can only be viewed on that machine. It cannot be watched on other machine without paying for it again from that machine.

How will we make this happen:- Every computer/machine has unique physical address we are gonna fetch that physical address from the machine which is downloading the movie and make that as a key and encrypt the video with that key. Now when we open the video the video file will check whether the encryption matches with the physical address of the computer/machine if it does play the video else throw an exception :).
